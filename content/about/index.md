Hello! I am a planetary science Ph.D. candidate at Caltech working with Dr. [Mike Brown](https://mikebrown.caltech.edu/). I am interested in studying the compositions of icy moons throughout the solar system, and the surface processes which affect them. I use ground- and space-based telescope spectroscopy, ranging from UV through mid-infrared wavelengths, to explore these worlds.

I grew up in Chandler, Arizona with a love for the sunshine, all things outdoors, and gymnastics. Ever since I was a kid, Iâ€™ve been fascinated by space. I knew I wanted to study Astronomy, but my focus on objects within our solar system came from finding some great mentors whose work I really admired. I studied both Astronomy and Physics at the University of Arizona and earned an M.Sc. in Applied Physics from Northern Arizona University, before beginning my PhD in Planetary Science at Caltech. As an undergrad, I enjoyed learning to use telescopes for my research, and I conducted laboratory experiments during my master's. In my Ph.D. work, I've combined these interests by coupling telescope observations and laboratory spectroscopy as a way of understanding the surface compostiions of icy satellites like Europa, Callisto, and the small moons of Uranus and Neptune.

Outside of work, I enjoy coffee dates with friends, hiking & rock climbing, and spending time with my husband Erik, daughter Sophie, and our two cats.
