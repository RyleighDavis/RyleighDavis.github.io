# My Research

I am broadly interested in understanding the compositions of icy moons and surfaces throughout the solar system, and what this can tell us about the formation and histories of the gas and ice giant systems. I use ground- and space-based telescopes, alongside laboratory spectra to explore these icy worlds. See below for info on some of my recent work!
