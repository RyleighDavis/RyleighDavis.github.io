summary: "Callisto's anient, heavily cratered surface preserves a surprisingly complex record of its past. By mapping its surface in ultraviolet and visible light, we found evidence for a chemically diverse mix of native (endogenic) and externally delivered (exogenic) dark material, shaped by radiation and ancient impacts. These findings challenge long-held assumptions about Callisto’s composition and shed new light on the evolution of Jupiter’s outermost moon."

# Callisto Isn't Boring After All: HST Spectroscopy Shows its Surface is a Complex Mix of Native and Delivered Material

This page is currently in development. Please check again soon! In the meantime, check out our recent paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00151).

<!-- Callisto's ancient and heavily cratered surface is shaped by impact craters and mass wasting (e.g landslides). Unlike it's neighbors, Callisto has not been altered by active geological processes and therefore preserves important clues about the history of the Jovian system and possibly the broader solar system as well.

We used the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to take a closer look at what’s actually on the surface of Callisto — and it turns out, there’s a lot to talk about.

## A Global Look in Ultraviolet and Visible Light

Using HST’s Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS), we captured high-resolution, spatially-resolved spectra of nearly the entire surface of Callisto, covering wavelengths from 200 to 1000 nm (UV to near-infrared). This is the most detailed UV-visible wavelength dataset ever obtained for Callisto, and it allows us to map how the moon reflects sunlight across different regions and wavelengths—essentially letting us track what materials might be where.

## The Highlights:

- **Dark vs. Bright Regions**: Callisto’s bright areas, often associated with water ice, tend to have relatively neutral or even slightly blue spectral slopes. In contrast, darker regions show redder slopes and stronger UV absorption—likely the result of non-ice materials like silicates, organics, or carbon-rich compounds.

- **Impact Basin Chemistry**: The huge Asgard and Valhalla impact basins don’t just look dramatic—they also stand out chemically. We found strong absorptions near 820 and 930 nm (possibly linked to iron-bearing silicates or phyllosilicates) and a newly identified 320 nm band, potentially pointing to complex organic material or irradiation products.

- **Mysterious UV Features**: We also detected two new UV absorption features near 230 and 450 nm. These might be from irradiated sodium salts like NaCl—materials that have been suggested for Europa, but are now tentatively popping up on Callisto. However, it is also possible that these features may be caused by other species like organics or silicates.

- **Rethinking Sulfur**: Sulfur dioxide (SO₂) has long been though to be present on Callisto's leading hemisphere based on a 280 nm feature seen in hemisphere ratio spectra. But our maps show that this "feature" likely just results from dividing two unrelated absorption bands—one found predominantly on the leading hemisphere (320 nm) and the other on the trailing (275 nm). In other words, the 280 nm bump is probably just a spectral illusion and overall we find little evidence for any expected sulfur-related absorptions at these wavelengths.


## Big Picture: A Chemically Patchy, Weathered World

What emerges from our mapping is a picture of a moon whose surface is a patchwork of different materials—some possibly delivered from elsewhere in the Jupiter system, others dug up from beneath by ancient impacts, and still others transformed by relentless exposure to charged particles from Jupiter’s magnetic field.

Surprisingly, despite years of speculation, we found very little spectral evidence for sulfur-bearing compounds like SO₂. Instead, the UV-visible spectrum seems to point more toward carbon-rich, silicate, and possibly salt-bearing materials—more asteroid-like than sulfurous.
Why It Matters

Understanding what’s on Callisto helps us piece together not just its own history, but the broader evolution of the Jovian system. It also tells us something about what happens to planetary surfaces when they’re exposed to space weathering, radiation, and exogenic material for billions of years.

This study also sets the stage for future missions that might explore Callisto more directly—such as NASA’s Europa Clipper or ESA’s JUICE mission, both of which will pass by Callisto on their journeys through the Jovian system. -->
