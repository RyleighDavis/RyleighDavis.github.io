A small absorption feature near 2.07μm on Europa's trailing hemisphere has been used as evidence for the presence of endogenic magnesium chloride (MgCl₂), possibly sourced from Europa's subsurface salty ocean. While the spectrum of MgCl₂ does not have this specific absorption feature, it could be altered via irradiation on Europa's trailing hemisphere into either more complex magnesium chlorate/perchlorate salts (Ligier et al. 2016) or if combined with Io-genic sulfur, into a sulfur-bearing salt such as epsomite (MgSO₄⋅10H₂O) (Brown et al. 2013). 

Both of these possibilities can explain the presence of an absorption feature at 2.07μm as arising from irradiation induced changes of endogenically sourced MgCl₂. However, if this feature does arise from an irradiation product of endogenic magnesium chloride, we would expect the absorption feature to be the strongest within Europa's young geologic features such as the recently disrupted chaos terrains, where the endogenic salty material is thought to be. 

Using archived VLT/SINFONI H+K band spectra, I showed that the presence and band area of the 2.07µm absorption feature is not spatially associated with the large-scale geology, but it is correlated with a bullseye-shaped irradiation pattern associated with Iogenic sulfur deposition (see [Davis et al. 2023](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/PSJ/aced96/meta)). 

This suggests that the absorption feature is unlikely to arise from the irradiation induced processing of endogenic MgCl₂, and therefore neither epsomite nor a combination of magnesium chlorate and perchlorate are likely to explain the spatial distribution of the absorption. Instead, we suggest that it may simply arise from some intermediary product of the radiolytic sulfur cycle, or perhaps form during the bombardment of water ice by electrons or the remaining (non-sulfur) ion species, independent of any endogenic material present within the recent geology. 

Unfortunately, we were not able to identify any candidate species within existing laboratory data and look forward to future laboratory experiments which may help identify the species responsible and provide insights into the nature of the sulfur radiolysis occurring on Europa.
