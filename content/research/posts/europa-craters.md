A classic example of irradiation-induced alteration of exogenic material on Europa's trailing hemisphere is the so-called radiolytic sulfur cycle, where Iogenic sulfur ions captured in Jupiter's magnetosphere are deposited on Europa's trailing hemisphere and subsequent irradiation produces hydrated sulfuric acid, along with a variety of potential sulfur-bearing intermediary products. Because of the intense irradiation environment on Europa's trailing hemisphere, these sulfur-bearing compounds are expected to be in radiation-induced equilibrium, with sulfuric acid continuously produced and destroyed in some steady state concentration. 

The timescale for reaching this equilibrium concentration on Europa's trailing hemisphere is not well known, but various estimates based on laboratory experiments have suggested timescales on the order of a few thousand years. In my recent paper ([Davis et al. 2024]()), I use Galileo/NIMS observations to show that both craters and their ejecta are depleted in sulfuric acid relative to nearby older terrains, suggesting that the radiolytic sulfur cycle has not yet had enough time to reach an equilibrium concentration of hydrated sulfuric acid. 

Based on estimates for the ages of these craters, we are able to place a lower limit of a few million years on the equilibrium timescale of Europa's sulfur cycle, which is significantly longer than what estimates based on laboratory experiments have suggested!

On the other hand, the crater and dark proximal ejecta appear to be enriched in salts relative to the bright white ejecta blanket at both craters, suggesting that the dark material exhumed by the impacts is relatively salt-rich. Endogenic salty material within Europa's other geologically young features like the chaos terrains, bands, and ridges become progressively darker and redder towards the trailing hemisphere apex, potentially due to irradiation induced reddening of salts. 

We expect that the salty material exhumed by the craters has also been darkened and reddened via irradiation based on their low-albedo and visually red coloration in the Galileo/SSI color images. We are therefore able to place an upper limit, of the age of Pwyll crater (~1 Myr), on the timescale over which this salty material is irradiation reddened on Europa's trailing hemisphere. Apparently irradiation induced reddening of salts operates on a much faster timescale than the radiolytic sulfur cycle on Europa's trailing hemisphere.
