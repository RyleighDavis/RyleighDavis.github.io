Coming soon! See our accepted Cycle 3 [JWST program](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/program-information?id=4645).

The ice giant systems of Uranus and Neptune remain among the least understood planetary systems in our solar system. Their small, irregular satellites preserve crucial information about the formation and evolutionary history of these distant worlds. Using the unprecedented infrared capabilities of the James Webb Space Telescope, we will conduct detailed spectroscopic observations of these small satellites to unlock their secrets.

Our research will focus on:
- Determining the surface compositions of Uranus and Neptune's small satellites
- Understanding capture vs. formation scenarios for irregular satellites
- Investigating the bombardment history of the outer solar system
- Reconstructing the dynamical evolution of ice giant systems
- Comparing ice giant satellite systems to better understand planetary formation

The small satellites of ice giants are particularly interesting because they may represent captured Kuiper Belt objects, remnants of the primordial solar nebula, or fragments from collisional disruption events. By studying their spectral properties with JWST's high sensitivity and spectral resolution, we can distinguish between these formation scenarios and piece together the complex history of how these distant planetary systems came to be.

This research will provide crucial insights into the formation of our solar system's most distant planets and help us understand similar systems around other stars.
