Coming soon! See our accepted Cycle 3 [JWST Program](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/program-information?id=4687).

This exciting research will use the James Webb Space Telescope to study Callisto's ancient surface composition, providing insights into the early formation and evolution of Jupiter's moon system. Callisto, being the most heavily cratered body in the solar system, preserves a record of the early bombardment history and primordial composition that has been largely erased from other Galilean satellites.

Our observations will help us understand:
- The primordial composition of materials in the outer solar system
- How the Jovian system formed and evolved
- The bombardment history of the outer solar system
- Callisto's role as a time capsule of early solar system conditions

Stay tuned for results from this groundbreaking research!
