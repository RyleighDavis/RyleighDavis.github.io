I am planetary scientist and Ph.D. candidate at Caltech, where I work with Dr. [Mike Brown](https://mikebrown.caltech.edu/) to study the surfaces of icy moons using spacecraft and telescope spectroscopy across UV to mid-infrared wavelengths. My research focuses on understanding the surface compositions and evolution of icy satellites - like Europa, Callisto, and the small inner moons of Uranus and Neptune - and what these surfaces can tell us about these unique worlds and how they formed. 

<!-- I will be graduating in early 2026 and aim to continue to pursue research in an academic or research role. -->

<!-- I have used spectroscopy to investigate how processes like irradiation, impact excavation, and the delivery of exogenic material have shaped the surfaces of these moons over time -->


<!-- ## Current Research Focus

I investigate radiation-driven processes that alter the surfaces of Jupiter's moons, particularly Europa and Callisto. Using spectroscopic observations from ground-based telescopes, the Hubble Space Telescope, and the James Webb Space Telescope, I work to decode the complex chemistry occurring on these distant worlds.

My work combines observational astronomy with laboratory spectroscopy to understand:
- How Jupiter's intense radiation environment chemically transforms Europa's surface 
- The composition and origin of dark material on Callisto's ancient surface  
- What these processes reveal about the formation and evolution of the outer solar system

## Recent Highlights

- **Europa's 2.07 μm Mystery**: Discovered that a puzzling absorption feature on Europa is linked to radiation patterns, not geological features—challenging ideas about ocean-derived materials on the surface.

- **Crater Chronometry**: Used Europa's youngest impact craters to show that radiation-driven chemical cycles operate on million-year timescales, much longer than previously thought.

- **JWST Observations**: Leading upcoming observations of Callisto and ice giant satellites to investigate their compositions and thermal histories. -->
